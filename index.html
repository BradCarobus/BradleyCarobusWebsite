            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. After high school graduation, my family and I relocated to South Carolina, this prompted my decision to attend Clemson University. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science with a major in Electrical Engineering,
                I am deeply passionate about the design and engineering processes that shape our everyday technology. </p>

            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <h2>Atlas Copco (Engineering Intern)</h2>
            <p>- I completed an internship with Atlas Copco's Product Company as an Electrical Engineering Intern. During this internship, I worked with the electrical engineering team and collaborated with a couple of other individuals on challenging projects
                that required me to think like an engineer in my approach.</p>
            <p>-I was responsible for reviewing and improving harness designs for road light harnesses. The goal was to make it easier for suppliers to understand the construction requirements and create a standardized drawing process for future road light
                harnesses. I also played a role in organizing the broken unit supply data by developing a process for proper data input, search, and editing to enhance usability. To achieve this, I created VBA macros and user forms windows to streamline
                the experience and make it more intuitive. </p>
            <h2>EPS FloTek, LLC (Engineering Intern)</h2>
            <p>-Worked in an intern position learning basic computational and fluid dynamics, working with programs such as Moldex3D, Rhinoceros, and Solid Works to help solve issues such as heating, warping, cracking, etc. in different plastic molds.
            </p>
            <p>-Used these programs to develop molding simulations and prepared final reports. I have gone to trade shows where I talked to potential customers and advertised this program and our engineering services</p>

            <img src="seniordesign_1.png" alt="Senior Design picture ">
            <p>
                For this project a group of ECE students and myself were assigned to work together in creating an automatic connect 4 board using an arduino and some motors. This project taught me alot of things including; Working with electrical components, simulink
                control systems, power conversion from AC to DC, and so much more.

        <div class="box-item">
            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>I've been programming for a total of 5+ years and have used many resources to enhance this skill, the programming languages I would say I'm proficent in are C, C#, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and MatLab. I've take multiple classes at <a href="#clemson">Clemson University</a>                that enhanced my knowledge of these languages, My team and I used MatLab programming in <a href="#design1">Senior Design Project 1</a>. which we also linked with simulink. Furthermore I completed a wide variety of LinkedIn learning classes
                in multiple programming languages that include; Python, C++, and machine learning.
